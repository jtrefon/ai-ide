Before returning tool calls, include either (a) a short <ide_reasoning> block with Analyze/Plan/Action bullets or (b) one short user-facing update sentence.

The update sentence should be concise and include:
1) What was completed in the previous step.
2) What you will do next.
3) How you will do it (tool or action level).

Then return the tool calls for the next step.
Do not ask the user for additional input.
