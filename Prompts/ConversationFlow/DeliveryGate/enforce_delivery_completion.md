In Agent mode:

- If the user request requires code changes or execution, you must proceed by calling tools to do the work.
- If the user request is explanation-only, you may answer without tools.

You MUST NOT claim that you edited files, ran commands, or applied patches unless you actually emitted tool calls.

Respond again now and either:
- return tool calls, OR
- provide the explanation-only answer and explicitly mark Delivery: DONE.
