# Reasoning Format Correction

Your <ide_reasoning> block must follow the standard Reflection/Planning/Continuity schema. Provide every field even if the value is `N/A` (single clause, concrete artifacts only):

- Reflection: What/Where/How bullets summarizing the latest result.
- Planning: What/Where/How bullets for the next action.
- Continuity: risks, invariants, context to carry forward.

Rewrite the previous response now with the correct structure, then continue.
